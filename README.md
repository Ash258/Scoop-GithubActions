# Github actions for scoop buckets

Set of automated actions, which bucket maintainers can use to save time managing issues / pull requests. Using a `stable` tag instead of a specific version is highly recommended.

## Available actions

`GITH_EMAIL` environment variable is not required since [1.0.1](https://github.com/Ash258/Scoop-GithubActions/releases/tag/1.0.1), but it is recommended.
If email is not specified, commits will not be pushed using account bounded to the email. This will lead to not adding contributions. ([See as example commit from github action without user's email](https://github.com/phips28/gh-action-bump-version/commit/adda5b22b3c785eb69d328f91dadb49a4c34a82e))

Use [`SHOVEL`](https://github.com/Ash258/Scoop-Core) environment variable for more advanced and optimized scoop implementation.

### Issues

As soon as a new issue **is created** or the **label `verify` is added** to an issue, the action is executed.
Based on the issue title, a specific sub-action is executed.
It could be one of these:

- **Hash check fails**
    1. Checkhashes binary is executed for manifest in title
    1. Result is parsed
        1. Hash mismatch
            1. Pull requests with name `<manifest>@<version>: Fix hash` are listed
                1. There is PR already
                    1. The newest one is selected
                    1. Description of this PR is updated with closing directive for created issue
                    1. Comment to issue is posted with reference to PR
                    1. Label `duplicate` added
                1. If none
                    1. New branch `<manifest>-hash-fix-<random>` is created
                    1. Changes are commited
                    1. New PR is created from this branch
            1. Labels `hash-fix-needed`, `verified` are added
        1. No problem
            1. Comment on issue is posted about hashes being right and possible causes
            1. Label `hash-fix-needed` is removed
            1. Issue is closed
        1. Binary error
            1. Label `manifest-fix-needed` is added
- **Download failed**
    1. All urls defined in manifest are retrieved
    1. Downloading of all urls is executed
    1. Comment to issue is posted
        1. If there is problematic URL
            1. List of these URLs is attached in comment
            1. Labels `manifest-fix-needed`, `verified`, `help wanted` are added
        1. All URLs could be downloaded without problem
            1. Possible causes are attached in comment

### Pull Requests

As soon as a PR **is created** or the **comment `/verify` is posted** to it, validation tests are executed (see [wiki](https://github.com/Ash258/Scoop-GithubActions/wiki/Pull-Request-Checks) for detailed desciption):

- ❗❗ [Pull request created from forked repository cannot be verified due to security concern from GitHub side](https://github.com/Ash258/Scoop-GithubActions/issues/42) ❗❗
    - Manual `/verify` comment is needed (<https://github.com/Ash258/GithubActionsBucketForTesting/pull/176>)

#### Overview of validatiors

1. Required properties (`License`, `Description`) are in place
1. Hashes of files are correct
1. Checkver functionality
1. Autoupdate functionality
    1. Hash extraction finished
